# Succinct representation of sparse matrices

## Project goal

The aim of this project is to study several data structures for representing
sparse matrices. We look at the space complexity of the structures. We also
study the possible algorithms for basic arithmetic operations multiplication and
addition. We will also implement the determinant computation.

We also implement a number of selected structures and the corresponding
operations. We will give an experimental comparison on the speed of the
implementations.
